Optionally, you can pass a starting crc integer to be mixed in with the checksum.  The crc parameter can be used to compute a checksum on data divided into chunks: performing crc32c(data2, crc32c(data1)) is equivalent to the checksum of [data1; data2]. (Technically, a little-endian checksum is computed.)\n\nThere is also a method crc32c(io, nb, crc) to checksum nb bytes from a stream io, or crc32c(io, crc) to checksum all the remaining bytes. Hence you can do open(crc32c, filename) to checksum an entire file, or crc32c(seekstart(buf)) to checksum an IOBuffer without calling take!.\n\nFor a String, note that the result is specific to the UTF-8 encoding (a different checksum would be obtained from a different Unicode encoding).

Note that the default comparison function on one dimensional slices sorts lexicographically.\n\nFor the remaining keyword arguments, see the documentation of sort!.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> sortslices([7 3 5; -1 6 4; 9 -2 8], dims=1) # Sort rows\n3×3 Array{Int64,2}:\n -1   6  4\n  7   3  5\n  9  -2  8\n\njulia> sortslices([7 3 5; -1 6 4; 9 -2 8], dims=1, lt=(x,y)->isless(x[2],y[2]))\n3×3 Array{Int64,2}:\n  9  -2  8\n  7   3  5\n -1   6  4\n\njulia> sortslices([7 3 5; -1 6 4; 9 -2 8], dims=1, rev=true)\n3×3 Array{Int64,2}:\n  9  -2  8\n  7   3  5\n -1   6  4\n\njulia> sortslices([7 3 5; 6 -1 -4; 9 -2 8], dims=2) # Sort columns\n3×3 Array{Int64,2}:\n  3   5  7\n -1  -4  6\n -2   8  9\n\njulia> sortslices([7 3 5; 6 -1 -4; 9 -2 8], dims=2, alg=InsertionSort, lt=(x,y)->isless(x[2],y[2]))\n3×3 Array{Int64,2}:\n  5   3  7\n -4  -1  6\n  8  -2  9\n\njulia> sortslices([7 3 5; 6 -1 -4; 9 -2 8], dims=2, rev=true)\n3×3 Array{Int64,2}:\n 7   5   3\n 6  -4  -1\n 9   8  -2\n\nHigher dimensions\n\nsortslices extends naturally to higher dimensions.

Note that while there is no default order on higher-dimensional slices, you may use the by or lt keyword argument to specify such an order.\n\nIf dims is a tuple, the order of the dimensions in dims is relevant and specifies the linear order of the slices. E.g., if A is three dimensional and dims is (1, 2), the orderings of the first two dimensions are re-arranged such such that the slices (of the remaining third dimension) are sorted. If dims is (2, 1) instead, the same slices will be taken, but the result order will be row-major instead.\n\nHigher dimensional examples\n\njulia> A = permutedims(reshape([4 3; 2 1; 'A' 'B'; 'C' 'D'], (2, 2, 2)), (1, 3, 2))\n2×2×2 Array{Any,3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 4  3\n 2  1\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n 'A'  'B'\n 'C'  'D'\n\njulia> sortslices(A, dims=(1,2))\n2×2×2 Array{Any,3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 1  3\n 2  4\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n 'D'  'B'\n 'C'  'A'\n\njulia> sortslices(A, dims=(2,1))\n2×2×2 Array{Any,3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 1  2\n 3  4\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n 'D'  'C'\n 'B'  'A'\n\njulia> sortslices(reshape([5; 4; 3; 2; 1], (1,1,5)), dims=3, by=x->x[1,1])\n1×1×5 Array{Int64,3}:\n[:, :, 1] =\n 1\n\n[:, :, 2] =\n 2\n\n[:, :, 3] =\n 3\n\n[:, :, 4] =\n 4\n\n[:, :, 5] =\n 5\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"base/sort/#Order-Related-Functions-1","page":"Sorting and Related Functions","title":"Order-Related Functions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"base/sort/#","page":"Sorting and Related Functions","title":"Sorting and Related Functions","text":"Base.issorted\nBase.Sort.searchsorted\nBase.Sort.searchsortedfirst\nBase.Sort.searchsortedlast\nBase.Sort.partialsort!\nBase.Sort.partialsort\nBase.Sort.partialsortperm\nBase.Sort.partialsortperm!","category":"page"},{"location":"base/sort/#Base.issorted","page":"Sorting and Related Functions","title":"Base.issorted","text":"issorted(v, lt=isless, by=identity, rev:Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)\n\nTest whether a vector is in sorted order.

Optional arguments should be represented with their default values (i.e. f(x, y=1)) when possible, following the actual Julia syntax. Optional arguments which do not have a default value should be put in brackets (i.e. f(x[, y]) and f(x[, y[, z]])). An alternative solution is to use several lines: one without optional arguments, the other(s) with them. This solution can also be used to document several related methods of a given function. When a function accepts many keyword arguments, only include a <keyword arguments> placeholder in the signature (i.e. f(x; <keyword arguments>)), and give the complete list under an # Arguments section (see point 4 below).\nInclude a single one-line sentence describing what the function does or what the object represents after the simplified signature block. If needed, provide more details in a second paragraph, after a blank line.\nThe one-line sentence should use the imperative form (\"Do this\", \"Return that\") instead of the third person (do not write \"Returns the length...\") when documenting functions. It should end with a period. If the meaning of a function cannot be summarized easily, splitting it into separate composable parts could be beneficial (this should not be taken as an absolute requirement for every single case though).\nDo not repeat yourself.\nSince the function name is given by the signature, there is no need to start the documentation with \"The function bar...\": go straight to the point. Similarly, if the signature specifies the types of the arguments, mentioning them in the description is redundant.\nOnly provide an argument list when really necessary.\nFor simple functions, it is often clearer to mention the role of the arguments directly in the description of the function's purpose. An argument list would only repeat information already provided elsewhere. However, providing an argument list can be a good idea for complex functions with many arguments (in particular keyword arguments). In that case, insert it after the general description of the function, under an # Arguments header, with one - bullet for each argument. The list should mention the types and default values (if any) of the arguments:\n\"\"\"\n...\n# Arguments\n- `n::Integer`: the number of elements to compute.\n- `dim::Integer=1`: the dimensions along which to perform the computation.\n...\n\"\"\"\nProvide hints to related functions.\nSometimes there are functions of related functionality. To increase discoverability please provide a short list of these in a See also: paragraph.\nSee also: [`bar!`](@ref), [`baz`](@ref), [`baaz`](@ref)\nInclude any code examples in an # Examples section.\nExamples should, whenever possible, be written as doctests. A doctest is a fenced code block (see Code blocks) starting with ```jldoctest and contains any number of julia> prompts together with inputs and expected outputs that mimic the Julia REPL.\nnote: Note\nDoctests are enabled by Documenter.jl. For more detailed documentation see Documenter's manual.\nFor example in the following docstring a variable a is defined and the expected result, as printed in a Julia REPL, appears afterwards:\n\"\"\"\nSome nice documentation here.\n\n# Examples\n```jldoctest\njulia> a = [1 2; 3 4]\n2×2 Array{Int64,2}:\n 1  2\n 3  4\n```\n\"\"\"\nwarning: Warning\nCalling rand and other RNG-related functions should be avoided in doctests since they will not produce consistent outputs during different Julia sessions. If you would like to show some random number generation related functionality, one option is to explicitly construct and seed your own MersenneTwister (or other pseudorandom number generator) and pass it to the functions you are doctesting.Operating system word size (Int32 or Int64) as well as path separator differences (/ or \\) will also affect the reproducibility of some doctests.Note that whitespace in your doctest is significant! The doctest will fail if you misalign the output of pretty-printing an array, for example.\nYou can then run make -C doc doctest=true to run all the doctests in the Julia Manual and API documentation, which will ensure that your example works.\nTo indicate that the output result is truncated, you may write [...] at the line where checking should stop. This is useful to hide a stacktrace (which contains non-permanent references to lines of julia code) when the doctest shows that an exception is thrown, for example:\n```jldoctest\njulia> div(1, 0)\nERROR: DivideError: integer division error\n[...]\n```\nExamples that are untestable should be written within fenced code blocks starting with ```julia so that they are highlighted correctly in the generated documentation.\ntip: Tip\nWherever possible examples should be self-contained and runnable so that readers are able to try them out without having to include any dependencies.\nUse backticks to identify code and equations.\nJulia identifiers and code excerpts should always appear between backticks ` to enable highlighting. Equations in the LaTeX syntax can be inserted between double backticks ``. Use Unicode characters rather than their LaTeX escape sequence, i.e. ``α = 1`` rather than ``\\\\alpha = 1``.\nPlace the starting and ending \"\"\" characters on lines by themselves.\nThat is, write:\n\"\"\"\n...\n\n...\n\"\"\"\nf(x, y) = ...\nrather than:\n\"\"\"...\n\n...\"\"\"\nf(x, y) = ...\nThis makes it more clear where docstrings start and end.\nRespect the line length limit used in the surrounding code.\nDocstrings are edited using the same tools as code. Therefore, the same conventions should apply. It is advised to add line breaks after 92 characters.\nProvide information allowing custom types to implement the function in an # Implementation section.

After A = B, changing elements of B will modify A as well.\nJulia values are not copied when passed to a function. If a function modifies an array, the changes will be visible in the caller.\nJulia does not automatically grow arrays in an assignment statement. Whereas in MATLAB a(4) = 3.2 can create the array a = [0 0 0 3.2] and a(5) = 7 can grow it into a = [0 0 0 3.2 7], the corresponding Julia statement a[5] = 7 throws an error if the length of a is less than 5 or if this statement is the first use of the identifier a. Julia has push! and append!, which grow Vectors much more efficiently than MATLAB's a(end+1) = val.\nThe imaginary unit sqrt(-1) is represented in Julia as im, not i or j as in MATLAB.\nIn Julia, literal numbers without a decimal point (such as 42) create integers instead of floating point numbers. As a result, some operations can throw a domain error if they expect a float; for example, julia> a = -1; 2^a throws a domain error, as the result is not an integer (see the FAQ entry on domain errors for details).\nIn Julia, multiple values are returned and assigned as tuples, e.g. (a, b) = (1, 2) or a, b = 1, 2. MATLAB's nargout, which is often used in MATLAB to do optional work based on the number of returned values, does not exist in Julia. Instead, users can use optional and keyword arguments to achieve similar capabilities.\nJulia has true one-dimensional arrays. Column vectors are of size N, not Nx1. For example, rand(N) makes a 1-dimensional array.\nIn Julia, [x,y,z] will always construct a 3-element array containing x, y and z.\nTo concatenate in the first (\"vertical\") dimension use either vcat(x,y,z) or separate with semicolons ([x; y; z]).\nTo concatenate in the second (\"horizontal\") dimension use either hcat(x,y,z) or separate with spaces ([x y z]).\nTo construct block matrices (concatenating in the first two dimensions), use either hvcat or combine spaces and semicolons ([a b; c d]).\nIn Julia, a:b and a:b:c construct AbstractRange objects. To construct a full vector like in MATLAB, use collect(a:b). Generally, there is no need to call collect though. An AbstractRange object will act like a normal array in most cases but is more efficient because it lazily computes its values. This pattern of creating specialized objects instead of full arrays is used frequently, and is also seen in functions such as range, or with iterators such as enumerate, and zip. The special objects can mostly be used as if they were normal arrays.\nFunctions in Julia return values from their last expression or the return keyword instead of listing the names of variables to return in the function definition (see The return Keyword for details).\nA Julia script may contain any number of functions, and all definitions will be externally visible when the file is loaded. Function definitions can be loaded from files outside the current working directory.\nIn Julia, reductions such as sum, prod, and max are performed over every element of an array when called with a single argument, as in sum(A), even if A has more than one dimension.\nIn Julia, parentheses must be used to call a function with zero arguments, like in rand().\nJulia discourages the use of semicolons to end statements. The results of statements are not automatically printed (except at the interactive prompt), and lines of code do not need to end with semicolons. println or @printf can be used to print specific output.\nIn Julia, if A and B are arrays, logical comparison operations like A == B do not return an array of booleans. Instead, use A .== B, and similarly for the other boolean operators like <, >.\nIn Julia, the operators &, |, and ⊻ (xor) perform the bitwise operations equivalent to and, or, and xor respectively in MATLAB, and have precedence similar to Python's bitwise operators (unlike C). They can operate on scalars or element-wise across arrays and can be used to combine logical arrays, but note the difference in order of operations: parentheses may be required (e.g., to select elements of A equal to 1 or 2 use (A .== 1) .| (A .== 2)).\nIn Julia, the elements of a collection can be passed as arguments to a function using the splat operator ..., as in xs=[1,2]; f(xs...).\nJulia's svd returns singular values as a vector instead of as a dense diagonal matrix.\nIn Julia, ... is not used to continue lines of code. Instead, incomplete expressions automatically continue onto the next line.\nIn both Julia and MATLAB, the variable ans is set to the value of the last expression issued in an interactive session. In Julia, unlike MATLAB, ans is not set when Julia code is run in non-interactive mode.\nJulia's structs do not support dynamically adding fields at runtime, unlike MATLAB's classes. Instead, use a Dict.\nIn Julia each module has its own global scope/namespace, whereas in MATLAB there is just one global scope.\nIn MATLAB, an idiomatic way to remove unwanted values is to use logical indexing, like in the expression x(x>3) or in the statement x(x>3) = [] to modify x in-place. In contrast, Julia provides the higher order functions filter and filter!, allowing users to write filter(z->z>3, x) and filter!(z->z>3, x) as alternatives to the corresponding transliterations x[x.>3] and x = x[x.>3]. Using filter! reduces the use of temporary arrays.\nThe analogue of extracting (or \"dereferencing\") all elements of a cell array, e.g. in vertcat(A{:}) in MATLAB, is written using the splat operator in Julia, e.g. as vcat(A...).","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/noteworthy-differences/#Noteworthy-differences-from-R-1","page":"Noteworthy Differences from other Languages","title":"Noteworthy differences from R","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/noteworthy-differences/#","page":"Noteworthy Differences from other Languages","title":"Noteworthy Differences from other Languages","text":"One of Julia's goals is to provide an effective language for data analysis and statistical programming. For users coming to Julia from R, these are some noteworthy differences:","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/noteworthy-differences/#","page":"Noteworthy Differences from other Languages","title":"Noteworthy Differences from other Languages","text":"Julia's single quotes enclose characters, not strings.\nJulia can create substrings by indexing into strings. In R, strings must be converted into character vectors before creating substrings.\nIn Julia, like Python but unlike R, strings can be created with triple quotes \"\"\" ... \"\"\". This syntax is convenient for constructing strings that contain line breaks.\nIn Julia, varargs are specified using the splat operator ..., which always follows the name of a specific variable, unlike R, for which ... can occur in isolation.\nIn Julia, modulus is mod(a, b), not a %% b. % in Julia is the remainder operator.\nIn Julia, not all data structures support logical indexing. Furthermore, logical indexing in Julia is supported only with vectors of length equal to the object being indexed. For example:\nIn R, c(1, 2, 3, 4)[c(TRUE, FALSE)] is equivalent to c(1, 3).\nIn R, c(1, 2, 3, 4)[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)] is equivalent to c(1, 3).\nIn Julia, [1, 2, 3, 4][[true, false]] throws a BoundsError.\nIn Julia, [1, 2, 3, 4][[true, false, true, false]] produces [1, 3].\nLike many languages, Julia does not always allow operations on vectors of different lengths, unlike R where the vectors only need to share a common index range.  For example, c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(1, 2) is valid R but the equivalent [1, 2, 3, 4] + [1, 2] will throw an error in Julia.\nJulia allows an optional trailing comma when that comma does not change the meaning of code. This can cause confusion among R users when indexing into arrays. For example, x[1,] in R would return the first row of a matrix; in Julia, however, the comma is ignored, so x[1,] == x[1], and will return the first element. To extract a row, be sure to use :, as in x[1,:].\nJulia's map takes the function first, then its arguments, unlike lapply(<structure>, function, ...) in R. Similarly Julia's equivalent of apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...) in R is mapslices where the function is the first argument.\nMultivariate apply in R, e.g. mapply(choose, 11:13, 1:3), can be written as broadcast(binomial, 11:13, 1:3) in Julia. Equivalently Julia offers a shorter dot syntax for vectorizing functions binomial.(11:13, 1:3).\nJulia uses end to denote the end of conditional blocks, like if, loop blocks, like while/ for, and functions. In lieu of the one-line if ( cond ) statement, Julia allows statements of the form if cond; statement; end, cond && statement and !cond || statement. Assignment statements in the latter two syntaxes must be explicitly wrapped in parentheses, e.g. cond && (x = value).\nIn Julia, <-, <<- and -> are not assignment operators.\nJulia's -> creates an anonymous function.\nJulia constructs vectors using brackets. Julia's [1, 2, 3] is the equivalent of R's c(1, 2, 3).\nJulia's * operator can perform matrix multiplication, unlike in R. If A and B are matrices, then A * B denotes a matrix multiplication in Julia, equivalent to R's A %*% B. In R, this same notation would perform an element-wise (Hadamard) product. To get the element-wise multiplication operation, you need to write A .* B in Julia.\nJulia performs matrix transposition using the transpose function and conjugated transposition using the ' operator or the adjoint function. Julia's transpose(A) is therefore equivalent to R's t(A). Additionally a non-recursive transpose in Julia is provided by the permutedims function.\nJulia does not require parentheses when writing if statements or for/while loops: use for i in [1, 2, 3] instead of for (i in c(1, 2, 3)) and if i == 1 instead of if (i == 1).\nJulia does not treat the numbers 0 and 1 as Booleans. You cannot write if (1) in Julia, because if statements accept only booleans. Instead, you can write if true, if Bool(1), or if 1==1.\nJulia does not provide nrow and ncol. Instead, use size(M, 1) for nrow(M) and size(M, 2) for ncol(M).\nJulia is careful to distinguish scalars, vectors and matrices.  In R, 1 and c(1) are the same. In Julia, they cannot be used interchangeably.\nJulia's diag and diagm are not like R's.\nJulia cannot assign to the results of function calls on the left hand side of an assignment operation: you cannot write diag(M) = fill(1, n).\nJulia discourages populating the main namespace with functions. Most statistical functionality for Julia is found in packages under the JuliaStats organization. For example:\nFunctions pertaining to probability distributions are provided by the Distributions package.\nThe DataFrames package provides data frames.\nGeneralized linear models are provided by the GLM package.\nJulia provides tuples and real hash tables, but not R-style lists. When returning multiple items, you should typically use a tuple or a named tuple: instead of list(a = 1, b = 2), use (1, 2) or (a=1, b=2).\nJulia encourages users to write their own types, which are easier to use than S3 or S4 objects in R. Julia's multiple dispatch system means that table(x::TypeA) and table(x::TypeB) act like R's table.TypeA(x) and table.TypeB(x).\nIn Julia, values are not copied when assigned or passed to a function. If a function modifies an array, the changes will be visible in the caller. This is very different from R and allows new functions to operate on large data structures much more efficiently.\nIn Julia, vectors and matrices are concatenated using hcat, vcat and hvcat, not c, rbind and cbind like in R.\nIn Julia, a range like a:b is not shorthand for a vector like in R, but is a specialized AbstractRange object that is used for iteration without high memory overhead. To convert a range into a vector, use collect(a:b).\nJulia's max and min are the equivalent of pmax and pmin respectively in R, but both arguments need to have the same dimensions.  While maximum and minimum replace max and min in R, there are important differences.\nJulia's sum, prod, maximum, and minimum are different from their counterparts in R. They all accept an optional keyword argument dims, which indicates the dimensions, over which the operation is carried out.  For instance, let A = [1 2; 3 4] in Julia and B <- rbind(c(1,2),c(3,4)) be the same matrix in R.  Then sum(A) gives the same result as sum(B), but sum(A, dims=1) is a row vector containing the sum over each column and sum(A, dims=2) is a column vector containing the sum over each row. This contrasts to the behavior of R, where separate colSums(B) and rowSums(B) functions provide these functionalities. If the dims keyword argument is a vector, then it specifies all the dimensions over which the sum is performed, while retaining the dimensions of the summed array, e.g. sum(A, dims=(1,2)) == hcat(10). It should be noted that there is no error checking regarding the second argument.\nJulia has several functions that can mutate their arguments. For example, it has both sort and sort!.\nIn R, performance requires vectorization. In Julia, almost the opposite is true: the best performing code is often achieved by using devectorized loops.\nJulia is eagerly evaluated and does not support R-style lazy evaluation. For most users, this means that there are very few unquoted expressions or column names.\nJulia does not support the NULL type. The closest equivalent is nothing, but it behaves like a scalar value rather than like a list. Use x === nothing instead of is.null(x).\nIn Julia, missing values are represented by the missing object rather than by NA. Use ismissing(x) (or ismissing.(x) for element-wise operation on vectors) instead of is.na(x). The skipmissing function is generally used instead of na.rm=TRUE (though in some particular cases functions take a skipmissing argument).\nJulia lacks the equivalent of R's assign or get.\nIn Julia, return does not require parentheses.\nIn R, an idiomatic way to remove unwanted values is to use logical indexing, like in the expression x[x>3] or in the statement x = x[x>3] to modify x in-place. In contrast, Julia provides the higher order functions filter and filter!, allowing users to write filter(z->z>3, x) and filter!(z->z>3, x) as alternatives to the corresponding transliterations x[x.>3] and x = x[x.>3]. Using filter! reduces the use of temporary arrays.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/noteworthy-differences/#Noteworthy-differences-from-Python-1","page":"Noteworthy Differences from other Languages","title":"Noteworthy differences from Python","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/noteworthy-differences/#","page":"Noteworthy Differences from other Languages","title":"Noteworthy Differences from other Languages","text":"Julia requires end to end a block. Unlike Python, Julia has no pass keyword.\nIn Julia, indexing of arrays, strings, etc. is 1-based not 0-based.\nJulia's slice indexing includes the last element, unlike in Python. a[2:3] in Julia is a[1:3] in Python.\nJulia does not support negative indices. In particular, the last element of a list or array is indexed with end in Julia, not -1 as in Python.\nJulia's for, if, while, etc. blocks are terminated by the end keyword. Indentation level is not significant as it is in Python.\nJulia has no line continuation syntax: if, at the end of a line, the input so far is a complete expression, it is considered done; otherwise the input continues. One way to force an expression to continue is to wrap it in parentheses.\nJulia arrays are column major (Fortran ordered) whereas NumPy arrays are row major (C-ordered) by default. To get optimal performance when looping over arrays, the order of the loops should be reversed in Julia relative to NumPy (see relevant section of Performance Tips).\nJulia's updating operators (e.g. +=, -=, ...) are not in-place whereas NumPy's are. This means A = [1, 1]; B = A; B += [3, 3] doesn't change values in A, it rather rebinds the name B to the result of the right-hand side B = B + 3, which is a new array. For in-place operation, use B .+= 3 (see also dot operators), explicit loops, or InplaceOps.jl.\nJulia evaluates default values of function arguments every time the method is invoked, unlike in Python where the default values are evaluated only once when the function is defined. For example, the function f(x=rand()) = x returns a new random number every time it is invoked without argument. On the other hand, the function g(x=[1,2]) = push!(x,3) returns [1,2,3] every time it is called as g().\nIn Julia % is the remainder operator, whereas in Python it is the modulus.\nThe commonly used Int type corresponds to the machine integer type (Int32 or Int64). This means it will overflow, such that 2^64 == 0. If you need larger values use another appropriate type, such as Int128, BigInt or a floating point type like Float64.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/noteworthy-differences/#Noteworthy-differences-from-C/C-1","page":"Noteworthy Differences from other Languages","title":"Noteworthy differences from C/C++","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/noteworthy-differences/#","page":"Noteworthy Differences from other Languages","title":"Noteworthy Differences from other Languages","text":"Julia arrays are indexed with square brackets, and can have more than one dimension A[i,j].

After A = B, changing elements of B will modify A as well. Updating operators like += do not operate in-place, they are equivalent to A = A + B which rebinds the left-hand side to the result of the right-hand side expression.\nJulia arrays are column major (Fortran ordered) whereas C/C++ arrays are row major ordered by default.

There are no numeric literal suffixes, such as L, LL, U, UL, ULL to indicate unsigned and/or signed vs. unsigned. Decimal literals are always signed, and hexadecimal literals (which start with 0x like C/C++), are unsigned. Hexadecimal literals also, unlike C/C++/Java and unlike decimal literals in Julia, have a type based on the length of the literal, including leading 0s. For example, 0x0 and 0x00 have type UInt8, 0x000 and 0x0000 have type UInt16, then literals with 5 to 8 hex digits have type UInt32, 9 to 16 hex digits type UInt64 and 17 to 32 hex digits type UInt128. This needs to be taken into account when defining hexadecimal masks, for example ~0xf == 0xf0 is very different from ~0x000f == 0xfff0. 64 bit Float64 and 32 bit Float32 bit literals are expressed as 1.0 and 1.0f0 respectively. Floating point literals are rounded (and not promoted to the BigFloat type) if they can not be exactly represented.  Floating point literals are closer in behavior to C/C++. Octal (prefixed with 0o) and binary (prefixed with 0b) literals are also treated as unsigned.\nString literals can be delimited with either \"  or \"\"\", \"\"\" delimited literals can contain \" characters without quoting it like \"\\\"\". String literals can have values of other variables or expressions interpolated into them, indicated by $variablename or $(expression), which evaluates the variable name or the expression in the context of the function.\n// indicates a Rational number, and not a single-line comment (which is # in Julia)\n#= indicates the start of a multiline comment, and =# ends it.\nFunctions in Julia return values from their last expression(s) or the return keyword.  Multiple values can be returned from functions and assigned as tuples, e.g. (a, b) = myfunction() or a, b = myfunction(), instead of having to pass pointers to values as one would have to do in C/C++ (i.e. a = myfunction(&b).\nJulia does not require the use of semicolons to end statements. The results of expressions are not automatically printed (except at the interactive prompt, i.e. the REPL), and lines of code do not need to end with semicolons. println or @printf can be used to print specific output. In the REPL, ; can be used to suppress output. ; also has a different meaning within [ ], something to watch out for. ; can be used to separate expressions on a single line, but are not strictly necessary in many cases, and are more an aid to readability.\nIn Julia, the operator ⊻ (xor) performs the bitwise XOR operation, i.e. ^ in C/C++.  Also, the bitwise operators do not have the same precedence as C/++, so parenthesis may be required.\nJulia's ^ is exponentiation (pow), not bitwise XOR as in C/C++ (use ⊻, or xor, in Julia)\nJulia has two right-shift operators, >> and >>>.  >>> performs an arithmetic shift, >> always performs a logical shift, unlike C/C++, where the meaning of >> depends on the type of the value being shifted.\nJulia's -> creates an anonymous function, it does not access a member via a pointer.\nJulia does not require parentheses when writing if statements or for/while loops: use for i in [1, 2, 3] instead of for (int i=1; i <= 3; i++) and if i == 1 instead of if (i == 1).\nJulia does not treat the numbers 0 and 1 as Booleans. You cannot write if (1) in Julia, because if statements accept only booleans. Instead, you can write if true, if Bool(1), or if 1==1.\nJulia uses end to denote the end of conditional blocks, like if, loop blocks, like while/ for, and functions. In lieu of the one-line if ( cond ) statement, Julia allows statements of the form if cond; statement; end, cond && statement and !cond || statement. Assignment statements in the latter two syntaxes must be explicitly wrapped in parentheses, e.g. cond && (x = value), because of the operator precedence.\nJulia has no line continuation syntax: if, at the end of a line, the input so far is a complete expression, it is considered done; otherwise the input continues. One way to force an expression to continue is to wrap it in parentheses.\nJulia macros operate on parsed expressions, rather than the text of the program, which allows them to perform sophisticated transformations of Julia code. Macro names start with the @ character, and have both a function-like syntax, @mymacro(arg1, arg2, arg3), and a statement-like syntax, @mymacro arg1 arg2 arg3. The forms are interchangeable; the function-like form is particularly useful if the macro appears within another expression, and is often clearest. The statement-like form is often used to annotate blocks, as in the distributed for construct: @distributed for i in 1:n; #= body =#; end. Where the end of the macro construct may be unclear, use the function-like form.\nJulia has an enumeration type, expressed using the macro @enum(name, value1, value2, ...) For example: @enum(Fruit, banana=1, apple, pear)\nBy convention, functions that modify their arguments have a ! at the end of the name, for example push!.\nIn C++, by default, you have static dispatch, i.e. you need to annotate a function as virtual, in order to have dynamic dispatch. On the other hand, in Julia every method is \"virtual\" (although it's more general than that since methods are dispatched on every argument type, not only this, using the most-specific-declaration rule).","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/noteworthy-differences/#Noteworthy-differences-from-Common-Lisp-1","page":"Noteworthy Differences from other Languages","title":"Noteworthy differences from Common Lisp","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/noteworthy-differences/#","page":"Noteworthy Differences from other Languages","title":"Noteworthy Differences from other Languages","text":"Julia uses 1-based indexing for arrays by default, and it can also handle arbitrary index offsets.\nFunctions and variables share the same namespace (“Lisp-1”).\nThere is a Pair type, but it is not meant to be used as a COMMON-LISP:CONS. Various iterable collections can be used interchangeably in most parts of the language (eg splatting, tuples, etc). Tuples are the closest to Common Lisp lists for short collections of heterogeneous elements. Use NamedTuples in place of alists. For larger collections of homogeneous types, Arrays and Dicts should be used.\nThe typical Julia workflow for prototyping also uses continuous manipulation of the image, implemented with the Revise.jl package.\nBignums are supported, but conversion is not automatic; ordinary integers overflow.\nModules (namespaces) can be hierarchical. import and using have a dual role: they load the code and make it available in the namespace. import for only the module name is possible (roughly equivalent to ASDF:LOAD-OP). Slot names don't need to be exported separately. Global variables can't be assigned to from outside the module (except with eval(mod, :(var = val)) as an escape hatch).\nMacros start with @, and are not as seamlessly integrated into the language as Common Lisp; consequently, macro usage is not as widespread as in the latter. A form of hygiene for macros is supported by the language. Because of the different surface syntax, there is no equivalent to COMMON-LISP:&BODY.\nAll functions are generic and use multiple dispatch. Argument lists don't have to follow the same template, which leads to a powerful idiom (see do). Optional and keyword arguments are handled differently. Method ambiguities are not resolved like in the Common Lisp Object System, necessitating the definition of a more specific method for the intersection.\nSymbols do not belong to any package, and do not contain any values per se. M.var evaluates the symbol var in the module M.\nA functional programming style is fully supported by the language, including closures, but isn't always the idiomatic solution for Julia. Some workarounds may be necessary for performance when modifying captured variables.","category":"page"},{"location":"stdlib/LibGit2/#LibGit2-1","page":"LibGit2","title":"LibGit2","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"stdlib/LibGit2/#","page":"LibGit2","title":"LibGit2","text":"The LibGit2 module provides bindings to libgit2, a portable C library that implements core functionality for the Git version control system.

However, the signatures of method definitions can be annotated to indicate the types of arguments in addition to their number, and more than a single method definition may be provided. When a function is applied to a particular tuple of arguments, the most specific method applicable to those arguments is applied.

[1] Using all of a function's arguments to choose which method should be invoked, rather than just the first, is known as multiple dispatch. Multiple dispatch is particularly useful for mathematical code, where it makes little sense to artificially deem the operations to \"belong\" to one argument more than any of the others: does the addition operation in x + y belong to x any more than it does to y?

A format of yyyy-mm specifies that the code y should have a width of four while m a width of two. Codes that yield numeric digits have an associated mode: fixed-width or minimum-width. The fixed-width mode left-pads the value with zeros when it is shorter than the specified width and truncates the value when longer. Minimum-width mode works the same as fixed-width except that it does not truncate values longer than the width.\n\nWhen creating a format you can use any non-code characters as a separator. For example to generate the string \"1996-01-15T00:00:00\" you could use format: \"yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS\". Note that if you need to use a code character as a literal you can use the escape character backslash.

For example a dt string of \"1996-01-15T00:00:00.0\" would have a format string like \"y-m-dTH:M:S.s\". If you need to use a code character as a delimiter you can escape it using backslash.

Of course, the real trouble comes when one asks what a character is. The characters that English speakers are familiar with are the letters A, B, C, etc., together with numerals and common punctuation symbols. These characters are standardized together with a mapping to integer values between 0 and 127 by the ASCII standard. There are, of course, many other characters used in non-English languages, including variants of the ASCII characters with accents and other modifications, related scripts such as Cyrillic and Greek, and scripts completely unrelated to ASCII and English, including Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, and Korean. The Unicode standard tackles the complexities of what exactly a character is, and is generally accepted as the definitive standard addressing this problem. Depending on your needs, you can either ignore these complexities entirely and just pretend that only ASCII characters exist, or you can write code that can handle any of the characters or encodings that one may encounter when handling non-ASCII text. Julia makes dealing with plain ASCII text simple and efficient, and handling Unicode is as simple and efficient as possible. In particular, you can write C-style string code to process ASCII strings, and they will work as expected, both in terms of performance and semantics. If such code encounters non-ASCII text, it will gracefully fail with a clear error message, rather than silently introducing corrupt results.

If you define a function expecting a string argument, you should declare the type as AbstractString in order to accept any string type.\nLike C and Java, but unlike most dynamic languages, Julia has a first-class type for representing a single character, called AbstractChar. The built-in Char subtype of AbstractChar is a 32-bit primitive type that can represent any Unicode character (and which is based on the UTF-8 encoding).\nAs in Java, strings are immutable: the value of an AbstractString object cannot be changed. To construct a different string value, you construct a new string from parts of other strings.\nConceptually, a string is a partial function from indices to characters: for some index values, no character value is returned, and instead an exception is thrown.

There are several options for achieving this, of which two recommended choices are:\na. For long-term projects, use    PkgTemplates:\njulia    using PkgTemplates    t = Template()    generate(\"MyPkg\", t)    This will create a blank package, \"MyPkg\", in your .julia/dev directory.    Note that PkgTemplates allows you to control many different options    through its Template constructor.\nIn step 2 below, edit MyPkg/src/MyPkg.jl to change the source code, and    MyPkg/test/runtests.jl for the tests.\nb. For \"throw-away\" projects, you can avoid any need for cleanup    by doing your work in your temporary directory (e.g., /tmp).\nNavigate to your temporary directory and launch Julia, then do the following:\njulia    pkg> generate MyPkg              # type ] to enter pkg mode    julia> push!(LOAD_PATH, pwd())   # hit backspace to exit pkg mode    If you restart your Julia session you'll have to re-issue that command    modifying LOAD_PATH.\nIn step 2 below, edit MyPkg/src/MyPkg.jl to change the source code, and create any    test file of your choosing.\nDevelop your package\nBefore loading any code, make sure you're running Revise: say using Revise or follow its documentation on configuring it to run automatically.\nThen navigate to the directory containing your test file (here assumed to be \"runtests.jl\") and do the following:\njulia> using MyPkg\n\njulia> include(\"runtests.jl\")\nYou can iteratively modify the code in MyPkg in your editor and re-run the tests with include(\"runtests.jl\").  You generally should not need to restart your Julia session to see the changes take effect (subject to a few limitations, see

It is recommended that these operations have nearly constant time complexity, or technically Õ(1) complexity, as otherwise some array functions may be unexpectedly slow. Concrete types should also typically provide a similar(A,T=eltype(A),dims=size(A)) method, which is used to allocate a similar array for copy and other out-of-place operations. No matter how an AbstractArray{T,N} is represented internally, T is the type of object returned by integer indexing (A[1, ..., 1], when A is not empty) and N should be the length of the tuple returned by size.

Increasing the index of dimension k by 1 should increase the index i of getindex(A,i) by stride(A,k).

Many functions simply \"pass through\" an argument to somewhere else, e.g. to another function or to a storage location.

Fortunately this case is easy to distinguish by simply considering whether a function calls one of its arguments (i.e. the argument appears in \"head position\" somewhere). Performance-critical higher-order functions like map certainly call their argument function and so will still be specialized as expected. This optimization is implemented by recording which arguments are called during the analyze-variables pass in the front end.

However, this argument means \"multiple dispatch is easy to optimize in practice\", and that we should therefore use it, not \"we should use single dispatch\"!) So the method cache uses the type of the first argument as its primary key. Note, however, that this corresponds to the second element of the tuple type for a function call (the first element being the type of the function itself). Typically, type variation in head position is extremely low – indeed, the majority of functions belong to singleton types with no parameters.

The naive approach (and indeed, what Julia itself did pre-0.7), is to simply make a \"box\" and then a pointer in the box to the actual value, similar to the previously mentioned \"boxed\" values. This is unfortunate, however, because of the number of small, primitive \"bits\" types (think UInt8, Int32, Float64, etc.) that would easily fit themselves inline in this \"box\" without needing any indirection for value access.

The type tag byte value is the index of the actual value's type in the Union type's order of types. For example, a type tag value of 0x02 for a field with type Union{Nothing, UInt8, Int16} would indicate that an Int16 value is stored in the 2 bytes of the field in the structure's memory; a 0x01 value would indicate that a UInt8 value was stored in the first 1 byte of the 2 bytes of the field's memory. Lastly, a value of 0x00 signals that the nothing value will be returned for this field, even though, as a singleton type with a single type instance, it technically has a size of 0.

In terms of layout, a Julia Array can include extra \"buffer\" space before and after its actual data values, which are tracked in the a->offset and a->maxsize fields of the jl_array_t* type. The \"type tag array\" is treated exactly as another jl_array_t*, but which shares the same a->offset, a->maxsize, and a->len fields. So the formula to access an isbits Union Array's type tag bytes is a->data + (a->maxsize - a->offset) * a->elsize + a->offset; i.e. the Array's a->data pointer is already shifted by a->offset, so correcting for that, we follow the data all the way to the max of what it can hold a->maxsize, then adjust by a->ofset more bytes to account for any present \"front buffering\" the array might be doing.

Indeed, Julia's compiler is in many ways much simpler than those of other dynamic languages (e.g. PyPy or LuaJIT).   Julia's performance advantage derives almost entirely from its front-end: its language semantics allow a well-written Julia program to give more opportunities to the compiler to generate efficient code and memory layouts.  If you tried to compile Matlab or Python code to Julia, our compiler would be limited by the semantics of Matlab or Python to producing code no better than that of existing compilers for those languages (and probably worse).  The key role of semantics is also why several existing Python compilers (like Numba and Pythran) only attempt to optimize a small subset of the language (e.g. operations on Numpy arrays and scalars), and for this subset they are already doing at least as well as we could for the same semantics.

Worse still, this would cause every computation involving integers to be type-unstable. As we mentioned above, type-stability is crucial for effective generation of efficient code.

While this superficially avoids type-instability at the level of Julia code, it just sweeps the problem under the rug by foisting all of the same difficulties onto the C code implementing this hybrid integer type. This approach can be made to work and can even be made quite fast in many cases, but has several drawbacks. One problem is that the in-memory representation of integers and arrays of integers no longer match the natural representation used by C, Fortran and other languages with native machine integers. Thus, to interoperate with those languages, we would ultimately need to introduce native integer types anyway. Any unbounded representation of integers cannot have a fixed number of bits, and thus cannot be stored inline in an array with fixed-size slots – large integer values will always require separate heap-allocated storage. And of course, no matter how clever a hybrid integer implementation one uses, there are always performance traps – situations where performance degrades unexpectedly. Complex representation, lack of interoperability with C and Fortran, the inability to represent integer arrays without additional heap storage, and unpredictable performance characteristics make even the cleverest hybrid integer implementations a poor choice for high-performance numerical work.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/faq/#","page":"Frequently Asked Questions","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","text":"An alternative to using hybrid integers or promoting to BigInts is to use saturating integer arithmetic, where adding to the largest integer value leaves it unchanged and likewise for subtracting from the smallest integer value.

Since the variable must be concrete, a contradiction occurs if its lower bound could not be a subtype of a concrete type. For example, an abstract type like AbstractArray cannot be a subtype of a concrete type, but a concrete type like Int can be, and the empty type Bottom can be as well. If a lower bound fails this test the algorithm stops with the answer false.","category":"page"},{"location":"devdocs/types/#","page":"More about types","title":"More about types","text":"For example, in the problem Tuple{Int,String} <: Tuple{T,T} where T, we derive that this would be true if T were a supertype of Union{Int,String}.

The difficulty is that whether a lower bound is concrete might depend on the values of other type variable bounds. For example, Vector{T} is equivalent to the concrete type Vector{Int} only if both the upper and lower bounds of T equal Int.

This means that workers started later on remote hosts (or by anyone with malicious intentions) are unable to connect to the cluster. An addprocs(4) followed by an addprocs([\"remote_host\"]) will fail. Some users may need to create a cluster comprising their local system and a few remote systems.

Additional SSH flags or credentials may be specified via keyword argument sshflags.\naddprocs(list_of_remote_hosts; tunnel=true, sshflags=<ssh keys and other flags>) is useful when we wish to use SSH connections for master-worker too.

The default atol is zero and the default rtol depends on the types of x and y. The keyword argument nans determines whether or not NaN values are considered equal (defaults to false).\n\nFor real or complex floating-point values, if an atol > 0 is not specified, rtol defaults to the square root of eps of the type of x or y, whichever is bigger (least precise). This corresponds to requiring equality of about half of the significand digits. Otherwise, e.g. for integer arguments or if an atol > 0 is supplied, rtol defaults to zero.\n\nx and y may also be arrays of numbers, in which case norm defaults to the usual norm function in LinearAlgebra, but may be changed by passing a norm::Function keyword argument. (For numbers, norm is the same thing as abs.) When x and y are arrays, if norm(x-y) is not finite (i.e. ±Inf or NaN), the comparison falls back to checking whether all elements of x and y are approximately equal component-wise.\n\nThe binary operator ≈ is equivalent to isapprox with the default arguments, and x ≉ y is equivalent to !isapprox(x,y).\n\nNote that x ≈ 0 (i.e., comparing to zero with the default tolerances) is equivalent to x == 0 since the default atol is 0.  In such cases, you should either supply an appropriate atol (or use norm(x) ≤ atol) or rearrange your code (e.g. use x ≈ y rather than x - y ≈ 0).   It is not possible to pick a nonzero atol automatically because it depends on the overall scaling (the \"units\") of your problem: for example, in x - y ≈ 0, atol=1e-9 is an absurdly small tolerance if x is the radius of the Earth in meters, but an absurdly large tolerance if x is the radius of a Hydrogen atom in meters.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> 0.1 ≈ (0.1 - 1e-10)\ntrue\n\njulia> isapprox(10, 11; atol = 2)\ntrue\n\njulia> isapprox([10.0^9, 1.0], [10.0^9, 2.0])\ntrue\n\njulia> 1e-10 ≈ 0\nfalse\n\njulia> isapprox(1e-10, 0, atol=1e-8)\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"base/math/#Base.sin-Tuple{Number}","page":"Mathematics","title":"Base.sin","text":"sin(x)\n\nCompute sine of x, where x is in radians.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"base/math/#Base.cos-Tuple{Number}","page":"Mathematics","title":"Base.cos","text":"cos(x)\n\nCompute cosine of x, where x is in radians.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"base/math/#Base.Math.sincos-Tuple{Float64}","page":"Mathematics","title":"Base.Math.sincos","text":"sincos(x)\n\nSimultaneously compute the sine and cosine of x, where the x is in radians.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"base/math/#Base.tan-Tuple{Number}","page":"Mathematics","title":"Base.tan","text":"tan(x)\n\nCompute tangent of x, where x is in radians.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"base/math/#Base.Math.sind","page":"Mathematics","title":"Base.Math.sind","text":"sind(x)\n\nCompute sine of x, where x is in degrees. \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"base/math/#Base.Math.cosd","page":"Mathematics","title":"Base.Math.cosd","text":"cosd(x)\n\nCompute cosine of x, where x is in degrees. \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"base/math/#Base.Math.tand","page":"Mathematics","title":"Base.Math.tand","text":"tand(x)\n\nCompute tangent of x, where x is in degrees. \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"base/math/#Base.Math.sinpi","page":"Mathematics","title":"Base.Math.sinpi","text":"sinpi(x)\n\nCompute sin(pi x) more accurately than sin(pi*x), especially for large x.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"base/math/#Base.Math.cospi","page":"Mathematics","title":"Base.Math.cospi","text":"cospi(x)\n\nCompute cos(pi x) more accurately than cos(pi*x), especially for large x.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"base/math/#Base.sinh-Tuple{Number}","page":"Mathematics","title":"Base.sinh","text":"sinh(x)\n\nCompute hyperbolic sine of x.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"base/math/#Base.cosh-Tuple{Number}","page":"Mathematics","title":"Base.cosh","text":"cosh(x)\n\nCompute hyperbolic cosine of x.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"base/math/#Base.tanh-Tuple{Number}","page":"Mathematics","title":"Base.tanh","text":"tanh(x)\n\nCompute hyperbolic tangent of x.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"base/math/#Base.asin-Tuple{Number}","page":"Mathematics","title":"Base.asin","text":"asin(x)\n\nCompute the inverse sine of x, where the output is in radians.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"base/math/#Base.acos-Tuple{Number}","page":"Mathematics","title":"Base.acos","text":"acos(x)\n\nCompute the inverse cosine of x, where the output is in radians\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"base/math/#Base.atan-Tuple{Number}","page":"Mathematics","title":"Base.atan","text":"atan(y)\natan(y, x)\n\nCompute the inverse tangent of y or y/x, respectively.\n\nFor one argument, this is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (1, y), returning a value in the interval -pi2 pi2.\n\nFor two arguments, this is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y), returning a value in the interval -pi pi.

It not only supports integer indices, but it supports non-scalar indexing, too. This means that views of views don't need two levels of indirection; they can simply re-compute the indices into the original parent array!\nHopefully by now it's fairly clear that supporting slices means that the dimensionality, given by the parameter N, is not necessarily equal to the dimensionality of the parent array or the length of the indices tuple.  Neither do user-supplied indices necessarily line up with entries in the indices tuple (e.g., the second user-supplied index might correspond to the third dimension of the parent array, and the third element in the indices tuple).\nWhat might be less obvious is that the dimensionality of the stored parent array must be equal to the number of effective indices in the indices tuple. Some examples:\nA = reshape(1:35, 5, 7) # A 2d parent Array\nS = view(A, 2:7)         # A 1d view created by linear indexing\nS = view(A, :, :, 1:1)   # Appending extra indices is supported\nNaively, you'd think you could just set S.parent = A and S.indices = (:,:,1:1), but supporting this dramatically complicates the reindexing process, especially for views of views. Not only do you need to dispatch on the types of the stored indices, but you need to examine whether a given index is the final one and \"merge\" any remaining stored indices together. This is not an easy task, and even worse: it's slow since it implicitly depends upon linear indexing.\nFortunately, this is precisely the computation that ReshapedArray performs, and it does so linearly if possible. Consequently, view ensures that the parent array is the appropriate dimensionality for the given indices by reshaping it if needed. The inner SubArray constructor ensures that this invariant is satisfied.\nCartesianIndex and arrays thereof throw a nasty wrench into the reindex scheme. Recall that reindex simply dispatches on the type of the stored indices in order to determine how many passed indices should be used and where they should go. But with CartesianIndex, there's no longer a one-to-one correspondence between the number of passed arguments and the number of dimensions that they index into. If we return to the above example of Base.reindex(S1, S1.indices, (i, j)), you can see that the expansion is incorrect for i, j = CartesianIndex(), CartesianIndex(2,1). It should skip the CartesianIndex() entirely and return:\n(CartesianIndex(2,1)[1], S1.indices[2], S1.indices[3][CartesianIndex(2,1)[2]])\nInstead, though, we get:\n(CartesianIndex(), S1.indices[2], S1.indices[3][CartesianIndex(2,1)])\nDoing this correctly would require combined dispatch on both the stored and passed indices across all combinations of dimensionalities in an intractable manner. As such, reindex must never be called with CartesianIndex indices. Fortunately, the scalar case is easily handled by first flattening the CartesianIndex arguments to plain integers. Arrays of CartesianIndex, however, cannot be split apart into orthogonal pieces so easily. Before attempting to use reindex, view must ensure that there are no arrays of CartesianIndex in the argument list. If there are, it can simply \"punt\" by avoiding the reindex calculation entirely, constructing a nested SubArray with two levels of indirection instead.","category":"page"},{"location":"devdocs/object/#Memory-layout-of-Julia-Objects-1","page":"Memory layout of Julia Objects","title":"Memory layout of Julia Objects","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"devdocs/object/#Object-layout-(jl_value_t)-1","page":"Memory layout of Julia Objects","title":"Object layout (jl_value_t)","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"devdocs/object/#","page":"Memory layout of Julia Objects","title":"Memory layout of Julia Objects","text":"The jl_value_t struct is the name for a block of memory owned by the Julia Garbage Collector, representing the data associated with a Julia object in memory.

Inclusion allows you to split a single program across multiple source files. The expression include(\"source.jl\") causes the contents of the file source.jl to be evaluated in the global scope of the module where the include call occurs. If include(\"source.jl\") is called multiple times, source.jl is evaluated multiple times. The included path, source.jl, is interpreted relative to the file where the include call occurs. This makes it simple to relocate a subtree of source files. In the REPL, included paths are interpreted relative to the current working directory, pwd().\nPackage loading: e.g. import X or using X. The import mechanism allows you to load a package—i.e. an independent, reusable collection of Julia code, wrapped in a module—and makes the resulting module available by the name X inside of the importing module. If the same X package is imported multiple times in the same Julia session, it is only loaded the first time—on subsequent imports, the importing module gets a reference to the same module.

The meaning of X in import X is context-dependent: which X package is loaded depends on what code the statement occurs in.

Packages from various registries are installed and managed using a common set of tools and workflows.

Different entities may use the same name to refer to unrelated packages. This possibility is unavoidable since these entities do not coordinate and may not even know about each other. Because of the lack of a central naming authority, a single project may end up depending on different packages that have the same name. Julia's package loading mechanism does not require package names to be globally unique, even within the dependency graph of a single project. Instead, packages are identified by universally unique identifiers (UUIDs), which get assigned when each package is created. Usually you won't have to work directly with these somewhat cumbersome 128-bit identifiers since Pkg will take care of generating and tracking them for you. However, these UUIDs provide the definitive answer to the question of \"what package does X refer to?\"","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/code-loading/#","page":"Code Loading","title":"Code Loading","text":"Since the decentralized naming problem is somewhat abstract, it may help to walk through a concrete scenario to understand the issue. Suppose you're developing an application called App, which uses two packages: Pub and  Priv. Priv is a private package that you created, whereas Pub is a public package that you use but don't control. When you created Priv, there was no public package by the name Priv. Subsequently, however, an unrelated package also named Priv has been published and become popular. In fact, the Pub package has started to use it. Therefore, when you next upgrade Pub to get the latest bug fixes and features, App will end up depending on two different packages named Priv—through no action of yours other than upgrading. App has a direct dependency on your private Priv package, and an indirect dependency, through Pub, on the new public Priv package. Since these two Priv packages are different but are both required for App to continue working correctly, the expression import Priv must refer to different Priv packages depending on whether it occurs in App's code or in Pub's code. To handle this, Julia's package loading mechanism distinguishes the two Priv packages by their UUID and picks the correct one based on its context (the module that called import).

On the other hand, every catch basic block would have n*m phi node arguments (n, the number of statements in the critical region, m the number of live values through the catch block). To work around this, we use a combination of Upsilon and PhiC (the C standing for catch, written φᶜ in the IR pretty printer, because unicode subscript c is not available) nodes. There is several ways to think of these nodes, but perhaps the easiest is to think of each PhiC as a load from a unique store-many, read-once slot, with Upsilon being the corresponding store operation. The PhiC has an operand list of all the upsilon nodes that store to its implicit slot. The Upsilon nodes however, do not record which PhiC node they store to. This is done for more natural integration with the rest of the SSA IR. E.g. if there are no more uses of a PhiC node, it is safe to delete is and the same is true of an Upsilon node. In most IR passes, PhiC nodes can be treated similar to Phi nodes. One can follow use-def chains through them, and they can be lifted to new PhiC nodes and new Upsilon nodes (in the same places as the original Upsilon nodes).

For example, some form of generic programming exists in ML, Haskell, Ada, Eiffel, C++, Java, C#, F#, and Scala, just to name a few. Some of these languages support true parametric polymorphism (e.g. ML, Haskell, Scala), while others support ad-hoc, template-based styles of generic programming (e.g. C++, Java). With so many different varieties of generic programming and parametric types in various languages, we won't even attempt to compare Julia's parametric types to other languages, but will instead focus on explaining Julia's system in its own right.

For example, external state is not preserved. To accommodate this, explicitly separate any initialization steps that must occur at runtime from steps that can occur at compile time. For this purpose, Julia allows you to define an __init__() function in your module that executes any initialization steps that must occur at runtime. This function will not be called during compilation (--output-*). Effectively, you can assume it will be run exactly once in the lifetime of the code. You may, of course, call it manually if necessary, but the default is to assume this function deals with computing state for the local machine, which does not need to be – or even should not be – captured in the compiled image.

To use only the local process and distribute over tasks, specify distributed=false. This is equivalent to using asyncmap. For example, pmap(f, c; distributed=false) is equivalent to asyncmap(f,c; ntasks=()->nworkers())\n\npmap can also use a mix of processes and tasks via the batch_size argument. For batch sizes greater than 1, the collection is processed in multiple batches, each of length batch_size or less. A batch is sent as a single request to a free worker, where a local asyncmap processes elements from the batch using multiple concurrent tasks.\n\nAny error stops pmap from processing the remainder of the collection. To override this behavior you can specify an error handling function via argument on_error which takes in a single argument, i.e., the exception. The function can stop the processing by rethrowing the error, or, to continue, return any value which is then returned inline with the results to the caller.\n\nConsider the following two examples. The first one returns the exception object inline, the second a 0 in place of any exception:\n\njulia> pmap(x->iseven(x) ? error(\"foo\") : x, 1:4; on_error=identity)\n4-element Array{Any,1}:\n 1\n  ErrorException(\"foo\")\n 3\n  ErrorException(\"foo\")\n\njulia> pmap(x->iseven(x) ? error(\"foo\") : x, 1:4; on_error=ex->0)\n4-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 0\n 3\n 0\n\nErrors can also be handled by retrying failed computations. Keyword arguments retry_delays and retry_check are passed through to retry as keyword arguments delays and check respectively. If batching is specified, and an entire batch fails, all items in the batch are retried.\n\nNote that if both on_error and retry_delays are specified, the on_error hook is called before retrying. If on_error does not throw (or rethrow) an exception, the element will not be retried.\n\nExample: On errors, retry f on an element a maximum of 3 times without any delay between retries.\n\npmap(f, c; retry_delays = zeros(3))\n\nExample: Retry f only if the exception is not of type InexactError, with exponentially increasing delays up to 3 times. Return a NaN in place for all InexactError occurrences.\n\npmap(f, c; on_error = e->(isa(e, InexactError) ?

In most languages, built-in numeric types, when used as operands to arithmetic operators with infix syntax, such as +, -, *, and /, are automatically promoted to a common type to produce the expected results. C, Java, Perl, and Python, to name a few, all correctly compute the sum 1 + 1.5 as the floating-point value 2.5, even though one of the operands to + is an integer. These systems are convenient and designed carefully enough that they are generally all-but-invisible to the programmer: hardly anyone consciously thinks of this promotion taking place when writing such an expression, but compilers and interpreters must perform conversion before addition since integers and floating-point values cannot be added as-is. Complex rules for such automatic conversions are thus inevitably part of specifications and implementations for such languages.\nNo automatic promotion. This camp includes Ada and ML – very \"strict\" statically typed languages. In these languages, every conversion must be explicitly specified by the programmer. Thus, the example expression 1 + 1.5 would be a compilation error in both Ada and ML. Instead one must write real(1) + 1.5, explicitly converting the integer 1 to a floating-point value before performing addition. Explicit conversion everywhere is so inconvenient, however, that even Ada has some degree of automatic conversion: integer literals are promoted to the expected integer type automatically, and floating-point literals are similarly promoted to appropriate floating-point types.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/conversion-and-promotion/#","page":"Conversion and Promotion","title":"Conversion and Promotion","text":"In a sense, Julia falls into the \"no automatic promotion\" category: mathematical operators are just functions with special syntax, and the arguments of functions are never automatically converted. However, one may observe that applying mathematical operations to a wide variety of mixed argument types is just an extreme case of polymorphic multiple dispatch – something which Julia's dispatch and type systems are particularly well-suited to handle. \"Automatic\" promotion of mathematical operands simply emerges as a special application: Julia comes with pre-defined catch-all dispatch rules for mathematical operators, invoked when no specific implementation exists for some combination of operand types. These catch-all rules first promote all operands to a common type using user-definable promotion rules, and then invoke a specialized implementation of the operator in question for the resulting values, now of the same type. User-defined types can easily participate in this promotion system by defining methods for conversion to and from other types, and providing a handful of promotion rules defining what types they should promote to when mixed with other types.","category":"page"},{"location":"manual/conversion-and-promotion/#Conversion-1","page":"Conversion and Promotion","title":"Conversion","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/conversion-and-promotion/#","page":"Conversion and Promotion","title":"Conversion and Promotion","text":"The standard way to obtain a value of a certain type T is to call the type's constructor, T(x).

When the type has fields, it wouldn't be clear whether the method was being added to the instance or its type.\nThe 3-argument form has the following arguments:\nargs[1]\nA function name, or false if unknown. If a symbol, then the expression first behaves like the 1-argument form above. This argument is ignored from then on. When this is false, it means a method is being added strictly by type, (::T)(x) = x.\nargs[2]\nA SimpleVector of argument type data. args[2][1] is a SimpleVector of the argument types, and args[2][2] is a SimpleVector of type variables corresponding to the method's static parameters.\nargs[3]\nA CodeInfo of the method itself. For \"out of scope\" method definitions (adding a method to a function that also has methods defined in different scopes) this is an expression that evaluates to a :lambda expression.\nstruct_type\nA 7-argument expression that defines a new struct:\nargs[1]\nThe name of the struct\nargs[2]\nA call expression that creates SimpleVector specifying its parameters\nargs[3]\nA call expression that creates SimpleVector specifying its fieldnames\nargs[4]\nA Symbol or GlobalRef specifying the supertype (e.g., :Integer or GlobalRef(Core, :Any))\nargs[5]\nA call expression that creates SimpleVector specifying its fieldtypes\nargs[6]\nA Bool, true if mutable\nargs[7]\nThe number of arguments to initialize. This will be the number of fields, or the minimum number of fields called by an inner constructor's new statement.\nabstract_type\nA 3-argument expression that defines a new abstract type. The arguments are the same as the first three arguments of struct_type expressions.\nprimitive_type\nA 4-argument expression that defines a new primitive type. Arguments 1, 2, and 4 are the same as struct_type. Argument 3 is the number of bits.\nglobal\nDeclares a global binding.\nconst\nDeclares a (global) variable as constant.\nnew\nAllocates a new struct-like object. First argument is the type. The new pseudo-function is lowered to this, and the type is always inserted by the compiler.  This is very much an internal-only feature, and does no checking. Evaluating arbitrary new expressions can easily segfault.\nsplatnew\nSimilar to new, except field values are passed as a single tuple. Works similarly to Base.splat(new) if new were a first-class function, hence the name.\nreturn\nReturns its argument as the value of the enclosing function.\nisdefined\nExpr(:isdefined, :x) returns a Bool indicating whether x has already been defined in the current scope.\nthe_exception\nYields the caught exception inside a catch block, as returned by jl_current_exception().\nenter\nEnters an exception handler (setjmp). args[1] is the label of the catch block to jump to on error.  Yields a token which is consumed by pop_exception.\nleave\nPop exception handlers. args[1] is the number of handlers to pop.\npop_exception\nPop the stack of current exceptions back to the state at the associated enter when leaving a catch block. args[1] contains the token from the associated enter.\ncompat: Julia 1.1\npop_exception is new in Julia 1.1.\ninbounds\nControls turning bounds checks on or off. A stack is maintained; if the first argument of this expression is true or false (true means bounds checks are disabled), it is pushed onto the stack. If the first argument is :pop, the stack is popped.\nboundscheck\nHas the value false if inlined into a section of code marked with @inbounds, otherwise has the value true.\nloopinfo\nMarks the end of the a loop. Contains metadata that is passed to LowerSimdLoop to either mark the inner loop of @simd expression, or to propagate information to LLVM loop passes.\ncopyast\nPart of the implementation of quasi-quote. The argument is a surface syntax AST that is simply copied recursively and returned at run time.\nmeta\nMetadata. args[1] is typically a symbol specifying the kind of metadata, and the rest of the arguments are free-form. The following kinds of metadata are commonly used:\n:inline and :noinline: Inlining hints.\nforeigncall\nStatically-computed container for ccall information. The fields are:\nargs[1] : name\nThe expression that'll be parsed for the foreign function.\nargs[2]::Type : RT\nThe (literal) return type, computed statically when the containing method was defined.\nargs[3]::SimpleVector (of Types) : AT\nThe (literal) vector of argument types, computed statically when the containing method was defined.\nargs[4]::Int : nreq\nThe number of required arguments for a varargs function definition.\nargs[5]::QuoteNode{Symbol} : calling convention\nThe calling convention for the call.\nargs[6:length(args[3])] : arguments\nThe values for all the arguments (with types of each given in args[3]).\nargs[(length(args[3]) + 1):end] : gc-roots\nThe additional objects that may need to be gc-rooted for the duration of the call.
